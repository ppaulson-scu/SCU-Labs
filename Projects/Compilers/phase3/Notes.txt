Modify parser to compute and print attributes
	pointers()
	specifier()
	declarator()
	similar changes made at global level
		global declarations/def and func parameters

Modify parser to print when you open and close
	eventually replaced with function calls

Begin implementing Type class

Before next lab:
	Finish Type and Symbol classes
	Replace prints with Type constructor calls and stream operator
		cout << typespec... << "ARRAY" << endl
		becomes
		cout << Type(typespec, indirection, ...) << endl

Week 2
Scope class
	find
	lookup
	enclosing/parent

write checker.cpp
	checks at global level
		function decl and def
		variable decl
	checks in inner scopes
		variable decl
		function calls
		variable usage
